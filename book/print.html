<p>Data Structures and Algorithms are closely connected, like space and time. A data structure is like space where many things exist and can move freely. This space has planets, stars, galaxies, and more. Some things move in a predictable way, while others don't.
But without time, these things don't matter. Nothing happens, and nothing changes.</p>
<p>It's the same with data structures and algorithms. Without algorithms, data is useless, and without data structures, algorithms can't work.
We use algorithms to create, access, update, and delete data structures.</p>
<p>In short, data structures and algorithms are like two sides of the same coin. One can't exist without the other.</p>
<p>The ability to write an efficient algorithm depends on the organization of data in an appropriate manner. This means algorithms can only be as good as the data structure they are designed for. In this book, we will learn how to design and implement data structures and algorithms.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="data-structure"><a class="header" href="#data-structure">Data Structure</a></h1>
<p>A data structure is a particular way of organizing data for particular types of operation. It is like a blueprint that shows how data is connected and organized.</p>
<p>To understand this better, we'll create a data structure of our own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we are a part of a club that focuses on competitive programming. We want to store the names of our members in our computer. The best programmer in our team creates a data structure keeping in mind some of the requirements.
Since we have a low turnover rate, we do not have to update the data structure often and as a result, we can afford to store it in a contiguous block of memory.
We need to be able to access the data structure quickly and efficiently. So, he assigns each entry a unique index number. Through this number we can access the name of the member.
To remove any confusion, we can only store the names of the members in the data structure. This means only strings are allowed.</p>
<p>The data structure that satisfies all the preceding requirements already exists. It is called an array. We'll learn more about arrays in the next sections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a computer, 'data' is ultimately represented as a sequence of zeros and ones (bits), but this representation is too low level for the human beings operating that computer to discern. Hence, we have data structures that are closer to the way humans can understand and visualize the structure of this data. This is because it is humans who have to develop and maintain the software systems - computers merely run them.</p>
<h2 id="operations-on-data-structures"><a class="header" href="#operations-on-data-structures">Operations on Data Structures</a></h2>
<p>Data structures need to have certain operations that help us to modify or access the content. These operations include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Traversal</strong>: This involves accessing each element of an array in a sequential order, either from start to end or vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Insertion</strong>: This is the process of adding a new element to an array. The new element can be inserted at the beginning, end, or any other position within the array, depending on the application. Existing elements may shift to accommodate the new element.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion</strong>: This operation involves removing an existing element from an array. Similar to insertion, an element can be deleted from any position within the array, and existing elements may shift to fill the gap.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: This process involves finding a specific element within an array by comparing the target element with each element in the array until a match is found.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting</strong>: This operation involves arranging elements in a specific order.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="algorithms"><a class="header" href="#algorithms">Algorithms</a></h1>
<p>An algorithm is a set of steps / instructions that leads to solving a problem. Algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science. They are used to accomplish a variety of computational tasks, such as performing calculations, or finding specific information in databases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How to make tea</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Boil one cup of water</p>
<p>Step 2: Add one teaspoon of tea leaves (with sugar if desired)</p>
<p>Step 3: if you want milk, add it at the 3 minute mark</p>
<p>Step 4: Heat tea to boiling point</p>
<p>Step 5: Pour into cup</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may not realize it, we also use algorithms in our daily lives. Our rituals after waking up, the specific way we choose to make our coffee, the way we fold our laundry, all these tasks are completed as a result of us following an algorithm which we have chosen to execute.</p>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-an-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#characteristics-of-an-algorithm">Characteristics of an algorithm</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Well-defined instructions</li>
<li>Finite number of steps</li>
<li>Zero or more input(s)</li>
<li>One or more output(s)</li>
<li>Consistent</li>
</ul>
<p>They can be expressed as natural languages, programming languages, pseudo code, flowcharts and control tables.</p>
<p>After we have chosen the representation of data as required, this data has to be processed somehow. This is what leads to the need of algorithms. The process of interest could be searching, sorting, encryption, etc. We will cover storing, searching, and sorting algorithms in detail, as they underlie much of computer science.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#types-of-algorithms">Types of Algorithms</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Search algorithm:</strong> This algorithm takes a token to be searched as input and outputs the address of that token in the data structure / database.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sorting algorithm:</strong> This algorithm is used to rearrange data structures based on a comparison operator, which decides the new order of data.</p>
<p><strong>3. Greedy algorithm:</strong> This algorithm solves optimization problems by finding the locally optimal solution, assuming it's the optimal solution at the global level.</p>
<!-- This definition lacks understanding -->
<p><strong>4. Hashing algorithm:</strong> This algorithm takes data and converts it into a uniform message with a hashing value.</p>
<p><strong>5. Backtracking algorithm:</strong> This algorithm finds a solution to a given problem in incremental approaches and solves it one section at a time.</p>
<p><strong>6. Divide and conquer algorithm:</strong> This algorithm divides a problem into many sub-problems. Each sub-problem can be solved independently to produce a sub-solution. These sub-solutions are then combined to make a solution.</p>
<p><strong>7. Encryption algorithm:</strong> This algorithm takes data and maybe an encryption key as input and outputs an encrypted data. Concurrently a decryption algorithm takes the encrypted data and decryption key as input and outputs the original text.</p>
<p><strong>8. Recursive algorithm:</strong> This algorithm calls itself repeatedly until a solution emerges. Recursive algorithms call themselves with a smaller values every time a recursive function is involved.</p>
<p>When writing algorithms to solve a problem in programming, or finding a solution to problem in general, we need to think about the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the algorithm supposed to do?</li>
<li>Does the algorithm do what it is supposed to do?</li>
<li>Is the algorithm efficient? And can it be made more efficient?</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="complexity"><a class="header" href="#complexity">Complexity</a></h1>
<p>Complexity is the process of comparing minimum 2 algorithms with respect to space and time.</p>
<p>An algorithm is said to be efficient and fast, if it takes to execute and consumes less memory space.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-complexity"><a class="header" href="#types-of-complexity">Types of complexity</a></h2>
<p>There are six types of complexity :-</p>
<ol>
<li>Constant Complexity. <code>[O(1)]</code></li>
<li>Logarithmic Complexity. <code>[O(logn)]</code></li>
<li>Linear Complexity. <code>[O(n)]</code></li>
<li>Quadratic Complexity. <code>[O(n^2)]</code></li>
<li>Factorial Complexity. <code>[O(n!)]</code></li>
<li>Exponential Complexity. <code>[O(2^n)]</code></li>
</ol>
<p>To measure complexity there are three steps:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Space Complexity.</li>
<li>Time Complexity.</li>
<li>Auxiliary Space.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="time-complexity"><a class="header" href="#time-complexity">Time Complexity</a></h1>
<p>Time complexity is the time required to execute an instruction.</p>
<p>Time complexity can also be described by estimating the number of elementary steps performed by an algorithm to complete its execution.</p>
<p>Asymptotic notations are used to find the time complexity.</p>
<p>Asymptotic notations are the mathematical way to represent Time complexity.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="space-complexity"><a class="header" href="#space-complexity">Space Complexity</a></h1>
<p>Space complexity is the amount of memory space that an algorthm or a problem takes during the execution of that particular algorithm.</p>
<p>Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then Auxiliary Space would be a better criterion than Space Complexity. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort, and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. The space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="array"><a class="header" href="#array">Array</a></h1>
<p>An array is a collection  of similar data types which are stored in contiguous memory locations. Each location has an index number through which we can access the element of that particular index.</p>
<p>In programming, we have to use data elements of similar type and similar purpose. Instead of declaring and defining every variable individually, we can use an array to store all of them together.</p>
<p><img src="array/../images/array.jpg" alt="Array representation" /></p>
<p>The array in the diagram has 8 elements, and hence we say its size is 8 (length in terms of Rust).</p>
<p>The line of numbers below the array is called the indices of the array. These numbers are the addresses of elements in the array. We access elements with the help of these number. An index number generally starts with 0.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to access the 4th element, you'll do that by its index, i.e. 4 - 1 = 3:</p>
<p><code>number = array[3]</code>;</p>
<p>In Rust an array can be defined in two methods. Each method comes with its pros and cons. The two types of array in rust are: Primitive type and Vector type.</p>
<h2 id="array-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#array-algorithms">Array Algorithms</a></h2>
<p>These algorithm while not specific to array data type, serve an important function while deal with them. While we don't need algorithms to traverse, access, or insert elements in arrays like we will in other data structures, there are some functionalities that require different algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="search-algorithms-"><a class="header" href="#search-algorithms-">Search Algorithms 🔍</a></h3>
<p>They serve the function of checking and retrieving information stored within some data structure where that data is stored.</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="array/../search_algorithms.html#linear-search-algorithm">Linear Search algorithm</a></strong>: It is also called sequential search algorithm. This algorithm works by sequentially iterating through the whole array from one end until the target element is round. If found, the algorithm returns its index, else - 1.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="array/../search_algorithms.html#binary-search-algorithm">Binary Search Algorithm</a></strong> This type of searching algorithm is used to find the position of a specific value contained in a sorted array. The binary search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer and is the best searching algorithm because its faster to run.</p>
<h3 id="sorting-algorithms-"><a class="header" href="#sorting-algorithms-">Sorting Algorithms 🧲</a></h3>
<p>Sorting algorithm rearrange a given array of elements in a specific order. In case of numbers, it could be ascending or descending order.</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="array/../sorting_algorithms.html#bubble-sort-algorithm">Bubble Sort</a></strong> It is the simplest sorting algorithm, where is iteratively swaps the adjacent algorithms if they are in the wrong order.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="array/../sorting_algorithms.html#selection-sort-algorithm">Selection Sort</a>:</strong> This algorithm works by iteratively selecting the smallest / largest element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the array.</p>
<p><strong>3. <a href="array/../sorting_algorithms.html#insertion-sort-algorithm">Insertion sort</a>:</strong> This sorting algorithm works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted array into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list.</p>
<p><strong>4. Merge sort:</strong> It is a sorting algorithm that follows the <em>divide and conquer</em> strategy. It works by iteratively dividing the input array into smaller sub-arrays and sorting those sub-arrays, then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.</p>
<p><strong>5. Quick sort:</strong> It is a sorting algorithm that implements the divide and conquer strategy and picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted.</p>
<p>We'll learn how to implement these algorithms after we have understood what arrays are.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-array"><a class="header" href="#types-of-array">Types of Array:</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-1d-array"><a class="header" href="#1-1d-array">1. 1D array:</a></h3>
<p>One dimensional array refers to an array that contains only a row of elements. A 1D array can be accessed by using a single index.</p>
<p><img src="array/../images/1darray.jpg" alt="1d array" /></p>
<p><strong>Initializing a 1D array</strong>: Arrays are one dimensional by default. When you initialize an array, like you did <a href="array/primitive.html#initializing-an-array">at the start</a>, you are initializing a 1D array.</p>
<p><strong>Use Case</strong>: 1D arrays are used when we have to store similar items contiguously. These items are related in some way.</p>
<h3 id="2d-array"><a class="header" href="#2d-array">2D array:</a></h3>
<p>Two Dimensional array refers to an array that contains rows as well as columns of element. A 2D array can be accessed by using two indices; one index specifying the row, the other specifying the column.</p>
<p><img src="array/../images//2darray.jpg" alt="2d array" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that the 1D array and 2D array figures have the same 8 elements. The only difference is how they are accessed.</p>
<p>We use only one index to access 4 from 1D: <code>array[2]</code>.
On the other hand, we have to use two two values to access 4 from 2D: <code>array[0][2]</code>.</p>
<p>In 2D array, we are actually storing arrays in a sequential order, i.e. we are storing an array of arrays. The first index specifies which array we want to access, (<code>0i</code>, <code>1i</code>), then we specify which element from that array we want to specify, (<code>0j</code>, <code>1j</code>, <code>2j</code>, <code>3j</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Initializing a 2D array</strong>: While arrays are stored in a single line, they are ideal for a One dimensional relationship. But in some cases you need to store elements that have a Two dimensional relationship. To structure that data in such a way, this is how we do it:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vector-type"><a class="header" href="#vector-type">Vector type</a></h1>
<p>Unlike arrays, a vector stores the size of the array as well. Arrays don't need to store its size. That is why we can access an array element even when we exceed the actual capacity. The boundaries are not defined.</p>
<p>Another thing about vectors is they're generally stored in a heap and they have a large size allocated than being used. As a result, when new values are inserted, the whole vector does not to be relocated to fulfill the size requirements.</p>
<p>As arrays and vectors, both copy items into another larger array / vector once more element(s) are added, vectors do the copying less often as they already have more capacity than the actual length.</p>

<p>In most cases, vectors are considered better than arrays for a few key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size flexibility:</strong> Vectors are dynamic, meaning their size can grow or shrink as needed during program execution. Arrays have a fixed size defined at the time of creation, which can lead to problems if you don't know exactly how many elements you'll need beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Memory management:</strong> Vectors handle memory allocation and de-allocation automatically. Arrays require manual memory management, which can be error-prone and lead to memory leaks.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in functionality:</strong> Vectors often come with additional features like methods for sorting, searching, and element insertion/deletion at specific positions. Arrays typically require manual implementation for these operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some situations where arrays might be preferable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> For fixed-size data sets, arrays can be slightly faster than vectors due to their simpler structure and lack of overhead for managing size changes.</li>
<li><strong>Memory usage:</strong> If you know the exact size you need upfront and memory usage is a critical concern, arrays can be a more memory-efficient choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>While learning algorithms on arrays, we'll be using vectors as our array data structures because they are easy to handle and have loads of helpful methods. We'll see some of the methods in the next section.</p>

<p>Now that we have learned the theoretical part of arrays and vectors, we'll be moving on to the more practical part, i.e., problem solving. In this section, we'll learn some methods of vectors that will come in handy, especially if you are solving problems in Rust.</p>

<p>In the <a href="array/./array_or_vector.html">'Array or Vector'</a> section, we saw the benefits of choosing vectors over arrays. Most of the time, we'll solve problems where the data structure is a vector, but some questions will have an array data structure. We'll see how we can solve problems in both types, but if you want to change the data type from an array to a vector, simply use the <code>to_vec</code> method.</p>

<h2 id="loops"><a class="header" href="#loops">Loops</a></h2>
<p>As we're using vectors as our data structures, it is only natural that we can use loops to iterate over them.</p>
<p>Let's see some different types of loops that we can use to iterate over vectors based on your needs.</p>
<h3 id="1-iterating-over-the-entire-vector"><a class="header" href="#1-iterating-over-the-entire-vector">1. Iterating over the entire vector</a></h3>
<p>The first situation that we'll encounter is when we want to iterate over the entire vector. Here, we can use loops that fundamentally do not break while iterating.</p>
<h4 id="11-for-loop"><a class="header" href="#11-for-loop">1.1 for loop</a></h4>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop is the more versatile loop in Rust. It allows us to iterate over the entire vector (or a portion of it).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we have a vector of integers, and we want to complete a function that outputs the sum of all the elements in the vector. Some of the ways we can do this are:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn find_sum_with_for(vector: Vec&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; i32 {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for element in vector {
        sum += element;
    }

    sum
}</code></pre>
<h4 id="12-iter-method"><a class="header" href="#12-iter-method">1.2 iter method</a></h4>
<p>Another way to iterate over the entire array is to use the <code>iter</code> method. This method returns an (iterator)[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/struct.Iter.html], which is an object that we can use to iterate over the vector.</p>
<p>The <code>iter()</code> is not helpful alone. So we pair it up with different methods depending on our requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>using closure</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    fn find_sum_with_for_each(vector: Vec&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; i32 {
    let mut sum = 0;
    vector.for_each(|element| {
        sum += element;
    });

    sum
}</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>using inbuilt method</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn find_sum_with_sum(vector: Vec&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; i32 {
    vector.iter().sum()
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-iterating-over-a-portion-of-the-vector"><a class="header" href="#2-iterating-over-a-portion-of-the-vector">2. Iterating over a portion of the vector</a></h3>

<p>On the surface level, string types are pretty simple. You write something in quotation marks, you assign it to a variable, and Voila! , you have a string type variable.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let hawai = "Knock Knock";
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But there is a lot going on behind the scenes, when we use a string. Luckily, Rust provides us two level of controls through its string types. These types are necessary to continue Rust's priority on safety and performance.</p>
<p>We'll be delving deeper into the two types of strings in rust in later sections</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="str"><a class="header" href="#str">&amp;str</a></h1>
<p><code>&amp;str</code> is a primitive string type in Rust. Another name for type is 'string slice'. It is called a string slice because it <em>is</em> a slice of a string.</p>
<p>Slices are references to the original string, so they don't own the data. This prevents unnecessary copying of data.</p>
<p>Every type of string in Rust is utf-8 encoded. That means we can initialize a string in any languages. We can also include emoticons. Now let's see how it's done.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let one_piece: &amp;str = "I am gonna be the King of the Pirates! ⚓🚢";
    let one_pisu: &amp;str = "海賊王に俺はなる！ ⚓🚢";

    println!("{}\n", one_piece);
    println!("{}", one_pisu);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When you extract a portion of a string which is <code>String</code> or a <code>&amp;str</code> type, you create a <code>&amp;str</code> type. The extraction is done with specifying the start and end index of the string in square brackets.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let greeting: &amp;str = "Hello, world!";
    let sub_str = &amp;greeting[0..5];

    println!("{}", greeting);
    println!("{}", sub_str);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<!-- IF you have the knowledge, add more information here --><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="string-1"><a class="header" href="#string-1">String</a></h1>
<p>The <code>String</code> type is a heap-allocated, mutable, sequence of UTF-8 encoded bytes. What this means is that the <code>String</code> type is stored on the heap, it can be modified, and it can store any character that is valid UTF-8 including emojis.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-string"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-string">Creating a String</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to initialize a <code>String</code> type. The first is by using the <code>String::from</code> method which takes a string slice as an argument. The second is converting a string literal to a <code>String</code> type using the <code>to_string</code> method.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    // let greet = "Hello world!".to_string();
    let greet = String::from("Hello World!");
    println!("{}", greet);
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>If you don't know the content of the string yet, you can use the <code>String::new</code> method to create an empty <code>String</code> type.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut empty_string = String::new();
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="extending-a-string"><a class="header" href="#extending-a-string">Extending a String</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to insert a string into an existing <code>String</code> type. The first is using the <code>push_str</code> method which takes a string slice as an argument. The second is using the <code>push</code> method which takes a character as an argument.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<p>A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of <em>Last In First Out (LIFO)</em>. This means that the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.</p>
<p>Stacks can be visualized as a stack of plates on a table. Only the top plate is accessible by the user. The plates below cannot be accessed until they are at the top i.e., the plates above them have been removed.</p>
<p>The way in which we define stack in rust is the same as we define a vector. The vector data structure can be used as both an array and a stack in rust. For instance, the operations provided for vector include the operations on stack.</p>
<h2 id="initializing-a-stack"><a class="header" href="#initializing-a-stack">Initializing a stack.</a></h2>

<p>A quueue is a linear data used to model a First In First Out (FIFO) system. Conceptually, we add elements to the end of the queue and remove elements from the front.</p>
<p>The queue is used to model a system where the order of elements is important. For example, in a print queue, the order of jobs is important, so we use a queue to manage the jobs.</p>
<p><img src="queue/../images/queue.jpg" alt="queue" /></p>
<p>In Rust, we use a <code>VecDeque</code> to implement a queue. The <code>VecDeque</code> is a double-ended queue that allows efficient insertion and removal at both ends. It is a wrapper around a <code>Vec</code> that provides additional methods for working with the queue.</p>
<h2 id="operations"><a class="header" href="#operations">Operations</a></h2>
<p>To import the <code>VecDeque</code> type, we need to add the following line at the top of our file:</p>

<h3 id="enqueue"><a class="header" href="#enqueue">Enqueue</a></h3>
<p>Enqueue is the operation of adding an element to the end of the queue. The <code>push_back</code> method is used to add an element to the back of the queue.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="linked-list"><a class="header" href="#linked-list">Linked list</a></h1>
<p>A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a collection of 'nodes' together via links i.e. pointers. A node consists of data value and a pointer to the address of the next node within the linked list. Nodes are not stored at contiguous locations, rather they are linked using pointers to different memory locations.</p>
<p>A linked list starts with a head node which points to the starting node of the linked list. Every node consists of data which holds the value associated with the node and a pointer which holds the memory address of the next node in linked list.</p>
<p>The last node is called the tail node in the list which points to null indicating the end of the list.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-linked-list"><a class="header" href="#types-of-linked-list">Types of linked list</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Singly linked list</li>

<p>Let's understand them in a bit more detail:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-singly-linked-list"><a class="header" href="#1-singly-linked-list">1. Singly linked list</a></h2>
<p>A node in the singly linked list consists of only two parts; data and next pointer. The data part stores the actual data of the node and the next part stores the address of its immediate successor.</p>
<p>A singly linked list can be traversed in only one direction.</p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><code>traverse</code>: This function is used to traverse through the linked list. It takes a pointer to the head node as an argument and traverses through the linked list.</li>
<li><code>push</code>: This function is used to insert a node at the end of the linked list. It takes a pointer to the head node and the data to be inserted as arguments.</li>
<li><code>pop</code>: This function is used to delete a node from the linked list. It takes a pointer to the head node and the pointer to the node to be deleted as arguments.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are multiple ways we can define a struct in Rust. We'll see three ways in this section:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the built-in linked list data type in Rust.</li>
<li>Using the <code>struct</code> keyword to create node data type.</li>
<li>Using the <code>enum</code> keyword to create node data type.</li>

<p>Rust provides a built-in linked list data type called <code>LinkedList</code>. It is a <a href="linked_list/linked_list.html#2-doubly-linked-list">doubly linked list</a>, but we can use it as a singly linked list as well.</p>
<p>We need to import the <code>LinkedList</code> from the <code>std::collections</code> module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::collections::LinkedList;</code></pre>
<p>To to create a linked list we can use the <code>new</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    let mut list = LinkedList::new();</code></pre>
<h4 id="operations-1"><a class="header" href="#operations-1">Operations</a></h4>
<p>There are two operations in a singly linked list to interact with the data:</p>

<h3 id="2-doubly-linked-list"><a class="header" href="#2-doubly-linked-list">2. Doubly linked list</a></h3>
<p>A node in doubly linked list consists of three parts; one part is data, other two parts are previous pointer and next pointer. The previous pointer holds the address of the previous node in linked list, the data part holds the actual data, and the next part holds the address of the next node in the linked list</p>
<p>As we have the address of the next as well as the previous node we can traverse in both directions in the linked list.</p>

<p>When you run this code, you will notice that the when you <code>push_back</code> elements, they are stored in the order in which they are pushed. However, when you <code>push_front</code> elements, they are stored in the reverse order. This is because the <code>push_front</code> function is inserting the new node at the beginning of the linked list.</p>

<p>As we already know, searching for a particular element in a collection is a recurring task in computer science. If the data is stored in an unsorted array, then to find the item in question, we'll need to check each element of the array until the correct one is found or the array is exhausted. On average, this will take <code>O(n/2)</code> checks, and in the worst case, it will take <code>O(n)</code> checks. If the collection is large, such as contact information of every person in a particular area, that will take a long time to search.</p>
<p>This problem can be optimized by sorting the data and then searching for the item in question using binary search. However, that introduces the overhead of sorting the data, which is not always possible, and maintaining a sorted array if items are inserted or removed. But what if we can speed up the storing and searching process without needing to maintain a sorted array?</p>
<p><strong>A binary search tree</strong> (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a comparable value; for any given node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node, and all the elements in its right subtree are greater than the node. This property is known as the BST property.</p>

<p>A hash map is a data structure that efficiently stores key-value pairs. Think of it as a dictionary where you can look up words (keys) that point to its meaning (value).</p>
<!-- TODO add hashmap image -->
<p>To use Hash map in your Rust code, you'll need to import it from <code>collections</code>. You can do that by adding the following line to your code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::collections::HashMap;</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-a-hashmap"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-hashmap">Creating a HashMap</a></h2>
<p>To create a hash map, you'll need to use the <code>HashMap::new()</code> method. This method returns an empty hash map. You can also use the <code>HashMap::with_capacity()</code> method to create a hash map with a specific capacity. The capacity is the number of elements the hash map can hold without resizing.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    let mut map = HashMap::new();</code></pre>
<h2 id="inserting-a-key-value-pair"><a class="header" href="#inserting-a-key-value-pair">Inserting a key-value pair</a></h2>
<p>To insert a key-value pair into a hash map, you'll need to use the <code>insert()</code> method. This method takes two arguments: the key and the value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    map.insert("apple", 7);
    map.insert("banana", 5);
    map.insert("cherry", 3);</code></pre>
<h2 id="accessing-a-value"><a class="header" href="#accessing-a-value">Accessing a value</a></h2>
<p>To access a value in a hash map, you'll need to use the <code>get()</code> method. This method returns an <code>Option</code> type, so you'll need to unwrap the value to access it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    let fruit = map.get("apple");
    println!("The fruit is {}", fruit.unwrap());</code></pre>
<h2 id="removing-a-key-value-pair"><a class="header" href="#removing-a-key-value-pair">Removing a key-value pair</a></h2>
<p>To remove a key-value pair from a hash map, you'll need to use the <code>remove()</code> method. This method takes the key as an argument and returns the value associated with that key.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    let apple = map.remove("apple");
    println!("The apple is {}", apple.unwrap());</code></pre>
<p>The whole code looks something like this:</p>

<p>A trie, also known as a prefix tree or digital tree, is a specialized tree-like data structure designed for efficient storage and retrieval of strings. It's particularly well-suited for scenarios where searching, inserting, and deleting strings based on their prefixes is a primary operation.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea behind a trie is that each node represents a possible character in a string. The edges emanating from a node correspond to the different characters that can follow that character. This structure allows for rapid traversal and search based on prefixes.</p>

<p>An important and recurring problem in computing is locating information. This problem is called as searching. To solve this problem, search algorithms are used.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed from the name of the algorithms, search algorithms help us locate data in data structures.</p>
<p>In order to simplify matters, we'll search through items in a array. Recalling what we learned in chapter 2, arrays are a collection of similar items stored in a contiguous location. Searching through it will be simple enough.</p>
<p>Let's discuss what a search algorithm will take as input and will give out as output.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input:</p>
<ol>
<li>the array</li>
<li>element to be searched</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="linear-search-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#linear-search-algorithm">Linear search algorithm</a></h1>
<p>The most straightforward approach to searching is to examine each element of the data structure sequentially. Concurrently this searching algorithm is called linear search or sequential search.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you're in a library, searching for a book by your favorite thriller author. You head to the thriller section and start scanning the shelves. You examine each book, one by one, until you find the one you're looking for. This process is akin to a linear search. There are a few possible outcomes: you might find the book you want, reach the end of the section without finding it, or decide to continue searching even after finding one book by the author, looking for additional titles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="algorithm"><a class="header" href="#algorithm">Algorithm</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The algorithm takes the array and the token (number to be searched) as input.</li>
<li>It compares the token with every element in the array.</li>
<li>If the token and element match, the algorithm returns the index of that element.</li>
<li>If the token doesn't match with any element (i.e., it reaches the end of the array), it returns <code>None</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's write a function that implements the preceding steps:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">{{#include ./code/algo/linear_search.rs:search_function}}</code></pre>
<p>Here, we created a function that accepts an array and the element to be searched and gives out the Option enum.</p>
<p>Inside the function, a <code>for</code> loop iterates through every element in the array, that element is compared with given token for equality. If equal, the index of the element enclosed inside <code>Some</code> is returned.  When the loop iterates through the array and cannot find the token, then the function returns <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a function let's give it the inputs</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    let array = vec![2, 9, 12, 18, 21, 26, 32, 37];
    let target = 21;</code></pre>
<p>Note that the by default type of both these variables is <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> and <code>i32</code> respectively.</p>
<p>By setting up the variables and the outputs in the main function</p>

    let index = linear_search(array, target);

    match index {
        Some(x) =&gt; println!("The element is at index {x}."),
        None =&gt; println!("The element is not present in the array."),

<p>When we write an algorithm, we have to consider the possibility that it can be improved in terms of performance. Performance may be improved as a result of less time required, and/or less space occupied.  Binary search algorithm is the improvement of linear search in that it reduces the time required to search for an element.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself, "Why not stick with linear search? It gets the work done." While we're working with minimal data in our examples, real-world scenarios often involve dealing with billions of units of data. In such cases, linear search would take O(5,000,000,000) on average and O(10,000,000,000) at worst. Those numbers don't look good, do they? That's why we need a more efficient algorithm for large datasets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You recently stumbled upon a word - Facet: a distinct feature or element in a problem - that you don't know the meaning of. And as you are a sane person, chose to find your answer in a dictionary.</p>
<p>You start by opening the dictionary right in the middle section. You see words starting with 'M'. Now you know that 'F', the first letter in you word, comes before 'M'. So you discard the letters after 'M'. Now the word you are looking for is somewhere between 'A' and 'M'.</p>
<p>You open the section roughly between 'A' and 'M', your new, smaller dictionary. You have found the 'F' section of the dictionary. Now you can choose to linearly search through the words.</p>
<p>With every iteration, you cut the search area in half. The first time you were searching through 26 letters. The second, you were searching through only 13. The next time would be half of that, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm-1"><a class="header" href="#algorithm-1">Algorithm</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>The algorithm starts with the entire sorted array.</li>
<li>It compares the target value with the middle element of the array.</li>
<li>If the target matches the middle element, the search is complete.</li>
<li>If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array.</li>
<li>If the target is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the array.</li>
<li>This process repeats, halving the search space each time, until the target is found or it's determined that the target is not in the array.</li>
</ol>
<p>Binary search is much faster than linear search for large datasets, with a time complexity of O(log n) compared to O(n) for linear search. 🚀</p>
<p>Let's write the function that implements the preceding steps:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn binary_search(array: Vec&lt;i32&gt;, token: i32) -&gt; Option&lt;usize&gt; {
    let mut low = 0;
    let mut high = array.len() - 1;

    while low &lt;= high {
        let mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if array[mid] == token {
            return Some(mid);
        } else if token &lt; array[mid] {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    None
}</code></pre>
<p>Here, we created a function that has the same input and output as the linear search algorithm. The only thing that has changed is the internal working</p>
<p>Two variables <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> are initialed to extreme points of the array. We then format a while loop which terminates when high is smaller than low. This suggests that we have been through the entire array and haven't found the <code>target</code> element.</p>
<p>In the loop, we initialize a <code>mid</code> variable which is the mid point of array to be searched in. If the <code>target</code> compared with element in mid index is equal, we return <code>Some(mid)</code>. If not then based on whether the element is smaller or larger than <code>target</code> we either reassign high to mid (new array will be on left side of <code>mid</code>), or low to mid (new array will be on the right side of <code>mid</code>). The visuals below will help.</p>

<p>If there is a more efficient way to search for an element in an array, then there must be a more efficient way to sort the array. That is where sorting algorithms come in.</p>
<p>Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order. This order can be ascending or descending. It is defined by a comparison function that compares two elements and returns a value that indicates their relative order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you're a student in a classroom. You're trying to sort the students in the classroom based on their grades. You have a list of students and their grades. You want to arrange the students in ascending order of their grades.</p>
<p>You start by comparing the first two students. If the first student's grade is higher than the second student's grade, you swap them. Then you compare the next two students. If the second student's grade is higher than the third student's grade, you swap them. This process continues until you reach the end of the list.</p>
<p>You repeat this process until you've sorted the entire list. This is a simple sorting algorithm.</p>

<p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues to iterate until the array is sorted. Since it compares N elements to N - 1, it is not efficient for large arrays.</p>

<li>It compares the second and third elements of the array.</li>
<li>If the second element is greater than the third, the algorithm swaps them.</li>
<li>This goes on till the end of the array. At this point, the largest element is in its correct position.</li>

        }
    }
    array
}</code></pre>
<p>Here, we created a function that accepts an array and gives out the sorted array.
We used a <code>for</code> loop to iterate over the array. The first <code>for</code> loop is set to iterate N times, where N is the length of the array. This is because we need displace every element to its sorted position. The second <code>for</code> loop iterates over the array N - i times, where i is the instance of the first loop. If the first loop has iterated i times, then i elements are sorted. So, in the second loop, we are only comparing N - i elements.</p>
<p>The <code>if</code> condition checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, then we swap them. This is done by using the <code>swap</code> function. The <code>swap</code> function takes two arguments, the first being the index of the first element and the second being the index of the second element.</p>
<p>At the end of the function, we return the sorted array.</p>

<p>Here, we created a function that accepts an array and gives out the sorted array.
We used a <code>for</code> loop to iterate over the array. The first <code>for</code> loop is set to iterate N - 1 times, where N is the length of the array. This is because we need to swap every element to its sorted position. The second <code>for</code> loop starts iterating from i + 1 till the end of the array because the elements before i are already sorted. So, in the second loop, we are only comparing N - i elements.</p>
<p>The <code>if</code> condition checks if the current element is smaller than the current minimum. If it is, then we swap them. This is done by using the <code>swap</code> function.</p>
<p>At the end of the function, we return the sorted array.</p>

<p>The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm compares each element with every other element in the array, resulting in quadratic time complexity.</p>
<p>The space complexity of selection sort is O(1), as it does not require any extra space other than the input array itself.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="insertion-sort-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#insertion-sort-algorithm">Insertion sort algorithm</a></h1>
<p>Insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly inserting an element from the unsorted part of the array into its correct position in the sorted part of the array. The algorithm continues to iterate until the array is sorted.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm-4"><a class="header" href="#algorithm-4">Algorithm</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>The algorithm takes the array as input.</li>
<li>It iterates over the array.</li>
<li>It compares the current element with the previous element.</li>
<li>If the current element is smaller than the previous element, the algorithm swaps them.</li>
<li>This goes on till the end of the array.</li>
<li>This process is repeated until the array is sorted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's write a function that implements the preceding steps:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn insertion_sort(mut array: Vec&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Vec&lt;i32&gt; {
    for i in 1..array.len() {
        let mut j = i;
        while j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; array[j] &lt; array[j - 1] {
            array.swap(j, j - 1);
            j -= 1;
        }
    }
    array
}</code></pre>
<p>We use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate over the array. Inside the loop, we initialize a variable <code>j</code> to the current index of the array. We then use a <code>while</code> loop to iterate over the array till j is greater than 0 and the current element is smaller than the previous element. If both conditions are true, then we swap current element with the previous element. We then decrement j by 1 to move to the previous element and check if the condition is true again.</p>
<p>At the end of the function, we return the sorted array.</p>

fn insertion_sort(mut array: Vec&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Vec&lt;i32&gt; {
