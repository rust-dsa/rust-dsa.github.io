# Sorting algorithms

If there is a more efficient way to search for an element in an array, then there must be a more efficient way to sort the array. That is where sorting algorithms come in.

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order. This order can be ascending or descending. It is defined by a comparison function that compares two elements and returns a value that indicates their relative order.

> Imagine you're a student in a classroom. You're trying to sort the students in the classroom based on their grades. You have a list of students and their grades. You want to arrange the students in ascending order of their grades. 
>
> You start by comparing the first two students. If the first student's grade is higher than the second student's grade, you swap them. Then you compare the next two students. If the second student's grade is higher than the third student's grade, you swap them. This process continues until you reach the end of the list.
>
> You repeat this process until you've sorted the entire list. This is a simple sorting algorithm.
